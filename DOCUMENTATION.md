# OneBlink Uploads - Usage

## Installation

```sh
npm install @oneblink/uploads --save
```

## Tenants

This helper library supports all OneBlink Productivity instances. There are some tenant based configuration properties which must be set accordingly. Unless you really know what you are doing, it is recommended most users instead use the [OneBlink Apps SDK](https://github.com/oneblink/apps) or the [OneBlink NodeJS SDK](https://github.com/oneblink/sdk-node-js).
